# Bottom-Zig
This in an implementaion of the Bottom Spec in Zig, now, this really a bad implementation, it decodes and encodes fine enough, but it ignores any non-encoded character when decoding
on the other hand, I did not use much of error control nor fine user interface, this will crash on you and it will be the same as it would've succeded
Why I am publishing something incomplete, since I don't care =3
